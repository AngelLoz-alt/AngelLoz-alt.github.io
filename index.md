## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs
* Lab 4
  The lab was an exciting study into programming, in which I created a dynamic program employing a variety of elements like variables, arithmetic operators, and conditional statements. It was a lot of fun to get into the edit-compile-run-test-release cycle and build a system that took inputs, computed, and created outputs. The black box testing, which ensured that the code was robust and bug-free, was one of the most fascinating portions. Learning to utilize the 'make' command for creating and testing the project was a real treatâ€”it provided a new dimension to the experience, making it both challenging and enjoyable.

* Lab 5
  Creating if statements to handle domain-specific rules was difficult and really fun throughout the lab, which was an amazing excursion into the field of programming logic. The project's use of several files to organize things created a degree of complexity that enhanced my experience. Also, the process of tackling the exciting challenge of converting integer data types to doubles was extremely interesting, especially when unit tests and system tests were used to inform decisions and development. All things considered, the lab proved to be quite enjoyable, blending creativity, problem-solving, and skill development into an engaging educational process.

* Lab 8
  The lab provided a fun introduction to command-line argument validation by making sure that inputs were accurate and managing them precisely. A pleasant rhythm was added to the program's functionality by writing a loop that easily skipped over the command name and traveled through all of the command-line inputs. It was fascinating to observe how this straightforward loop improved the code's overall resilience and made processing inputs feel satisfying and seamless throughout. All in all, learning about the nuances of command-line inputs and how they fit seamlessly into the logic of the program.
